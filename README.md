# ESLint Plugin Demo
This tutorial follows the following [article](https://flexport.engineering/writing-custom-lint-rules-for-your-picky-developers-67732afa1803) which I found in [How to Write an ESLint Rule for Beginners](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2021/09/06/how-to-write-an-es-lint-rule-for-beginners.html).

Although the latter article seems like for beginners, I found it to be easier to learn from the former.

## Requirements
1. Yeoman Generator (`yo`)
2. Generator ESLint (`generator-eslint`)
